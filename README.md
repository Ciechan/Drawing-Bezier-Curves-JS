Drawing Bézier Curves
=====================

This repo contains a canvas/JS based implementation of Bézier curves drawing method as [presented in my blog post](http://ciechanowski.me/blog/2014/02/18/drawing_bezier_curves/). This little library powers the interactive demos embedded in the mention article.

**Disclaimer**: I'm not a JavaScript programmer and the code is most likely awful. You probably shouldn't consider this a good JS learning resource.
